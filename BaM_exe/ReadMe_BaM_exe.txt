The uncertainty quantification at mostly all steps of the tools in BayDERS is performed through BaM (BAyesian Modelling), developed by Benjamin Renard (INRAE) with the use of a few Fortran libraries developed by Dmitri Kavetski (University of Adelaide).

BaM represents a probabilistic Bayesian approach and is based on the Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm (MCMC) to explore the posterior distribution of inferred parameters. For a better description of this algorithm, please see Renard et al. [2006].
